<p>Cryptocurrency</p>
<p>What is Blockchain? Literally a chain of blocks. A blockchain is a complex time-stamped series record of data containing information about transactions which is scattered by a bunch of computers; which makes it useful as each one of them has a copy of the Blockchain. Each transaction generates a hash, and each block refers to the previous block and together make the Blockchain. </p>

<p>Cryptocurrencies will open up so many rooms for payments, especially when it comes to shopping online. More and more sites are preferably welcoming Bitcoin as a payment option. Although this may not affect me much, this will open allow me to get more of a variety when it comes to paying for my wants and needs. Especially in Hong Kong, there has been an increase in Cryptocurrency machines, in which we can sell cryptocurrencies for real cash. Obviously where there is pros, there are cons. With cryptocurrency being increasingly popular, since cryptocurrency is very hard to track, it increases the rate of cybercrime, which me means for a consumer like myself; the chances of me getting involved in an online scam becomes higher.</p>

<p>Machine Learning</p>
<p> Machine learning teaches AI about teaching itself, learning without constant (read: 24/7) supervision and correction from humans. By teaching it to develop an understanding of the relationship between the terms it comes across, an AI can draw from its previous “experiences” through pattern recognition. Through this, an AI can develop and flesh out a program on its own once given a founding set of instructions or goal from human hands. In some ways, the overarching concept could be compared to the way a declarative programming language works: You give the system a goal, and the system works towards that goal without you having to provide instructions on how the goal is achieved. </p>

<p> Currently, the strengths of machine learning seem to be quite clear: while machines and computers easily trump humans in areas of logic, fields that require more abstract thinking are much more elusive to grasp. For instance, teaching a computer to read and comprehend an image the same way a human would is surprisingly difficult. Humans can easily recognise objects that are depicted in an abstract manner, whereas computers will often take the image far too literally. Where a human can immediately learn to understand that a cartoon traffic light is still a traffic light, a computer that hasn’t had enough time to develop its database on the features that define a traffic light may only see a gray rectangle with three coloured circles inscribed upon it. </p>

<p> However, although it is difficult and expensive at the moment, this is not an entirely insurmountable hill for machine learning to overcome. A common technique used to bypass the obscurity and ambiguity of images is to implement tags, words that are consistent and uniform and thus far easier to recognise patterns in, and generate conclusions from. Even pure/raw images are not impossible to work with, and some highly developed artificial intelligence are capable of generating extremely convincing images of human faces, complete with expressions that are real enough to fool a human viewer. </p>

<p>Machine Learning, ultimately, is a means for humanity to surpass the limits of their own minds. Computers and machines, when you put aside their current flaws, learn at an incredible speed, and their growth can move at an exponential rate. Not only that, but they can process so much more information overall. No amount of humans could ever recreate something like Youtube’s recommendation algorithm at such an effective level, and at such high speeds. With machine learning comes all sorts of autonomy - autonomy that comes from autonomy. To provide computers with brains, and thus provide them the means to accomplish all sorts of tasks that humans would normally have to pilot manually. The core of countless chat AI comes from basic machine learning that continues to teach itself how to respond better, and that could serve as the fundamental for countless forms of consultation and reception work. Free from bias, free from mental harm, and far more efficient.</p>
