    <th> What's my ideal job? </th>
    <td>Data Science</td>
    <td>Software Engineering</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th> Whatâ€™s appealing about it to me? </th>
    <td>Mathematical and analytical with direct real-world applications, problem solving intensive.</td>
    <td>The ability to apply coding knowledge and translate them into a piece of application in which users would be able to use.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th> Required knowledge </th>
    <td>Fluency in programming in a variety of languages

Proficiency with databases.

Strong mathematical skills

Ability to translate data to information for a less adept audience

Familiarity with cloud computing

Machine Learning</td>
    <td>
Confident in programming languages, such as but not limited to C#, C++, Java, etc.

Ability to cope with high demand from employers and work under pressure.
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th> What knowledge do I have now? </th>
    <td>I have only the basic fundamentals of programming and databases.

My mathematics are notably above average, passed Specialist Maths in VCE.

I can do simple data visualisations, have briefly touched on using data visualisation software like NodeBox.

Extremely basic understanding of cloud computing, and I barely know what machine learning is.</td>
    <td>
As of right now, I only have basic programming knowledge in C# and C++.

Good communication and leadership skills.

Decent ability to understand coding tasks.
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th> WWhat will it take to get the remaining skills? </th>
    <td>Complete an undergraduate course in Information Technology before taking on a post-graduate qualification for Data Science.</td>
    <td>Complete a degree in Computer Science

Classes online to better my knowledge in certain aspects of coding
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th> Variety of work </th>
    <td>
There is a fairly large range of things involved with data science. Not only do I need to do a lot of work around the data itself, such as storing, processing and analysing, I also need to convert it into digestible media for others as well.
</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th> Level of teamwork </th>
    <td>May depend on the scale of the organisation/business that I am under. Does not inherently require multiple people, but having a team of specialists to accomplish our tasks would be best.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th> Demand for creativity </th>
    <td>Requires good problem solving skills and the ability to generate new yet feasible/realistic hypotheses for gathering data around and analysing towards.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Opportunities for personal development and growth </th>
    <td>Arguably does not require/demand constant personal growth, but constant honing and refinement of my knowledge in newer software can help with the efficiency of my tasks.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th> Interaction with general public </th>
    <td>May not necessarily be direct interaction, but I will most likely have to communicate information to them.</td>
