<p> Kerry Lam </p>
<p> Hello, my name is Kerry Tsz Man Lam. My student code is S3839262. You can contact me through my student email, s3839262@student.rmit.edu.au.

Initially, my engagement with IT was limited to whatever was directly involved with computer games. My curiosity for the topic only truly began when I learnt of artificial superintelligence and the world changing effects of such an entity. Eventually, I became disillusioned to the fantastically ambitious aspects of IT, but discovered a more sustainable path in IT for myself when I did Informatics in VCE.

While I still like to hear about the fantasy-like accomplishments of IT, I'd like to move my career towards the more lowkey side, dealing with data and analysis. </p>

<p> Hello! I am Hansel Chang (s3792078). If you wish to contact me, please do so by emailing me on my RMIT student email s3792078@student.rmit.edu.au.
Originally pursuing a business degree, my interest in I.T sparked when I realised half the stuff I was learning can easily be done with the help of technology. After completing my Diploma, I did a switch over to I.T, which is where I am at today. I feel that with the world today constantly changing, it will only allow more room for technology to excel. After hours of thinking and advice, I do believe I’d like to shift my future towards the technology sector. </p>

<p> My strength lies in being an accelerator for my team. While I may easily lose sight of the big picture and come up with impractical solutions or lack confidence and assertiveness when trying to provide a direction, I will pick up the pace quickly once the team gathers their bearings around the problem that we need to solve.

This means that in a group dynamic, I am at my weakest as a leader or director, though that does not mean I am most effective as a minor pawn; I excel in a position where I have established authority and gained the respect of my group’s members, as that is where I can bring energy and raise morale while foregoing the scenarios that expose my lack of assertiveness and impracticality. Additionally, my flexibility and creativity can become the glue of my group as I will have a natural tendency to find a suitable compromise for everyone in the case of a conflict. Overall, contrary to my leanings to introversion, I work more effectively as an individual in a group than alone. </p>

<p> Like most people, I do tend to procrastinate a bit. However, I would like to think of myself as someone who makes sure everything gets done right and on time. When the adrenaline hits, I do get everything going, quick. Although I may not be the smartest one in the group, I definitely communicate a lot, and I believe without communication no groups can work out.
I’m the type of guy who usually wouldn’t be the one who steps up to become a leader, however, will step up if there’s no one to. In a group project, I would like to make sure that everyone’s on the right track as that is very crucial. Having work divided up in a group project means it allows endless potential from each member, one working on something in which they are good at and ultimately discussing everything and allowing us to receive more inputs then what one’s brain can think of. </p>
