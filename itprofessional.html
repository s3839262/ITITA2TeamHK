<p> This is a reminder to self to fix the dang bideo and redo notes </p>

<p> The life of an IT professional </p>

<br>

<p> Data scientist </p>
<p>  “Data science is about using data to create as much of an impact as possible for your company.”

Self motivated, requires dedication towards the challenge/task itself, rather than for additional rewards such as money or fame. Critical thinking and creative problem solving skills, ability to take the initiative and take the lead/be dominant often, and comfort in collaboration and teamwork.</p>

Insights, data products, product recommendations; provides direction for the company.

communication - visualisations, code/programs, models

"discovering useful information from data"

Computer science + Data mining = Data science. Information in a more technical context.

Handling 'Big Data'

Data vs Knowledge

Problem solver, Strategist

Communicates with the higher ups/directors of the company. Usually the only data scientist in the team, working with other specialists like IT-type engineers

<p> Software Engineer </p>
<p>General public - people who might not be aware of the technical aspect of  software engineering and make ambitious demands.

culture is mildly hostile - elitism

business/financial drive forced into passion/altruism projects. Can be draining mentally for those who do soft engineering purely for the sake of software engineering.

1. Building a feature
Creativity, coming up with something new
2. Fixing bugs
Addressing immediate issues, prioritising, constant work
3. continued learning
Learning from the bugs and code combing
4. Communication
Working with team/client to dig into issues, what went wrong?
5. Production issues


tl;dr: constant trial and error

<p> Web Developer</p>
<p>Workload varies, provides chance for personal/self guided growth and learning.

Getting stuck on a problem - having to rebuild and heavily reinforce background knowledge for a task/project.

Rather sedentary - very office-y lifestyle

Having to combat burnout

Meetings and communication with team and boss. Communications can vary from being consistently with team including a proxy with client, or direct contact with client depending on how high up you are in the industry.

Thinking, problem identification and solving is the main thing that you do - once you think out a solution, typing out the code to solve that problem is generally relatively quick.</p>
